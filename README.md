# Pathfinding Visualizer

Simple pathfinding visualizer created in Unity 

## Installing

Download the latest standalone executable file from the [releases](https://github.com/FrankWan27/PathfindingVis/releases) page (Windows only).

If you have a Mac or Linux computer that can run Unity, just download the entire project and import it as a Unity project.


## About this project
I created this project because I wanted to learn a bit more about pathfinding algorithms and thought it would be cool to see them visualized in 3d space. It's quite useful to see the difference in accuracy and efficiency of different algorithms. For example, while the A* algorithm explored a much greater number of nodes (the blue/green colored nodes), it resulted in a shorter path than the greedy algorithm (the purple line).
